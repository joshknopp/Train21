# Train21
A blackjack basic strategy trainer written in Javascript.

Note: This is NOT a full blackjack game! There is no wagering, and hands are not played out in full.  It is merely intended to help train according to basic strategy.

The code is sloppy and was hacked together very quickly; it needs much optimization.  It is also my first foray into Angular, so... don't expect much.  :)

Future enhancements may include:

-Persistence mechanism for tracking right/wrong responses

-Logic to repeat hands that were played incorrectly
